# OnlineStoreBackend
First I would like to thank you!

My project has a backend and a frontend part. The attached pdf contained details about the functionalities only, the methods not.

To make my backend usable, I created a GUI in Angular. Unfortunately I'm not that good in Angular, that is why it took me so much time to make progress with the development.
